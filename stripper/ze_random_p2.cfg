;Changes:
;	- INTERSTELLAR ESCAPE 9: Prop solidity allow players to get ahead. As a cheap way to get around this... We disable prop solidity. It's not needed anyway.
;	- CITY NIGHT ESCAPE: Zombie breakable door. Health is far lower.
;	- CITY NIGHT ESCAPE: Kill player velocity on last TP for smoother transition that doesnt throw player into a wall.
;	- COUCH ESCAPE: Couch fix? Sometimes it doesn't sync well with the client.
;	- COUCH ESCAPE: Reduce box health.
;	- COUCH ESCAPE: Enforce plebs not shooting couch inappropriately.
;	- ICE CAP ESCAPE: Watermelon delayed.
;	- Round time usually isn't enough. Extended to 12 minutes.
;	- Delay particles more to ensure they show in the server
;	- Stops leftover shake from previous rounds.
;	- player_speedmod replacements.
;	- Prevent CTs abusing ZMs in cage
;	- Remove game_weapon_manager
;	- Reduce obnoxiousness of shake at boss fight. (Also favors sm_noshake)
;	- Boss has a glow, to indicate what/where to shoot.
;	- Additional breakable health, to make up for zombies knifing through each other.
