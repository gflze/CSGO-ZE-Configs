;Changes:
;	- Fix TP/nuke avoidance spot
;	- Make level 1 lift have a 5 second warning before it goes up
;	- Block off the admin room on levels 1-3
;	- Makes it so that players cannot hurt the level 3 ending laser boss before it spawns in
;	- Hopefully fix some lag common on level 4 by using sv_gravity for low grav
